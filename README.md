## Projects

| Project | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| **1. Cloud Migration and Optimization** | This project focuses on migrating a legacy on-premises application to Microsoft Azure. The goal is to enhance scalability, performance, and cost-efficiency. The process involves assessing the existing infrastructure, planning the migration strategy, and implementing best practices for cloud optimization. Key components include setting up virtual networks, configuring Azure services, and leveraging Azure Monitor for ongoing performance monitoring. |
| **2. Containerized Microservices with Kubernetes** | This project aims to refactor a monolithic application into a microservices architecture using Docker and Kubernetes. Each microservice is containerized and deployed to a Kubernetes cluster for improved scalability and resilience. The project covers setting up a Kubernetes cluster, creating Docker images, and defining Kubernetes manifests. Additionally, it incorporates service discovery, load balancing, and automated scaling. |
| **3. Infrastructure as Code with Terraform** | This project involves creating and managing infrastructure on multiple cloud providers using Terraform. The objective is to establish a consistent and reproducible infrastructure setup. Tasks include writing Terraform configuration files, provisioning resources such as virtual machines and databases, and managing state files. The project also explores advanced Terraform features like modules, remote state management, and integration with CI/CD pipelines. |

## Opensource Contributions

| Project | Description | Link |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Template Library** | Contribute to a library of Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates that provide reusable configurations for common Azure services. This project involves creating, testing, and documenting ARM templates for resources such as virtual machines, storage accounts, and networking components. The goal is to help the community quickly deploy and manage Azure infrastructure with best practices. Contributions can include templates, sample configurations, and detailed usage guides. | [opensource link](https://somethingishere.com) |
| **Kubernetes Helm Charts Repository** | Join an open-source repository of Helm charts to simplify Kubernetes application deployments. The project focuses on developing and maintaining Helm charts for popular applications and services. Contributors are responsible for creating new charts, updating existing ones, and ensuring compatibility with the latest Kubernetes versions. The repository aims to provide easily deployable, customizable, and well-documented Helm charts for the Kubernetes community. | [opensource link](https://somethingishere.com) |
| **Terraform Provider Development** | Participate in the development of a Terraform provider for a specific cloud service or platform. This project involves writing code to enable Terraform to interact with the API of the chosen service, allowing users to manage its resources declaratively. Contributors work on implementing resource definitions, data sources, and authentication mechanisms. The project also includes writing comprehensive documentation and example usage scenarios to help users integrate the provider into their infrastructure as code workflows. | [opensource link](https://somethingishere.com) |
